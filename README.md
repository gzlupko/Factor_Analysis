# Factor_Analysis

This R repository analyzes questionnaire data collected from Martin & Doris's (2003) research on the development of a humor measurement scale. The Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) was created to measure individuals' styles of humor. The HSQ is made up of 32 items designed to measure the supposed multiple underlying psychological psychological traits that, together, contribute to an individuals' sense and style of humor.

In this repository, I employ Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to determine the underlying multiple dimensions of the humor construct that the researchers had in mind. After assessing EFA model fit statistics, I conduct Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and assess CFA model fit statistics to determine whether certain items from the Humor Styles Questionnaire should be removed. Later I compare relative model fit statistics between the EFA and CFA models to determine the best factor structure for the data.
